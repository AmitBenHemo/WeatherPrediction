# Weather Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting weather patterns through time series analysis. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, the project aims to understand and forecast weather conditions effectively. We've employed KMeans and DBSCAN clustering methods, followed by meticulous hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models. The effectiveness of the clustering is evaluated using silhouette scores, providing insight into the cohesion and separation of the clusters formed.

## Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: Leverage historical weather data to model and forecast future weather conditions.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Implementation of KMeans to group data points representing similar weather patterns.
- **DBSCAN Clustering**: Application of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify clusters and outliers in weather data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Detailed tuning of algorithm parameters to achieve optimal model performance.
- **Silhouette Score Visualization**: Analysis of the clustering efficiency and validation of the model consistency through silhouette score metrics.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally, execute the code, and replicate the analysis.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x

- SciPy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://your-repository-link.com/project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd path-to-your-project
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project and perform the weather prediction analysis:

1. Ensure the data files are placed in the designated data directory.
2. Execute the main script to start the analysis:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Replace `main.py` with the script you use to conduct your analysis.

## Results

The project outputs include:

- Cluster labels for the weather data points.
- Optimized parameters for both KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms.
